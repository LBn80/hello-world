Trying to learn...

Hi anyone/everyone!

I'm trying to learn some new skills to get some interesting new paths in life :D
Right now I want to understand how I could incorporate writing codes (or shat it is called) in my work.
I want to be able to use the computer and Arduino (or any other similar product(s)) for creating ideas into working things...

I'm completely new to this and have just started (yesterday afternoon) and found this place, which seems to be an excellent place to get tips, help and support... Hope I'm right!

I'm right now working on a very (for most of you) simple code to get a single NO-switch to operate a 4-relay module, where I want to have the following functions:

1. When the button is pressed and released any random relay will activate after any given time. (just one of them. The others               will still be off).

2. If the button is pressed and hold down for lets say 10 seconds. I want the 4-relay module to start activating/deactivating all the 4 relays one at a time (with a adjustable delay for ON/OFF).

3. I want to be able to return from (2.) by lets say pressing and holding down the button again for lets say 5 seconds. And than be able to use (1.) again.

I've got the 1. to work in 2 different ways, but I think the "random" function probably could be much more sophisticated... Any tips are very appriciated!

How can I get the function 2. and 3. working? Any tips?

Sincerely,
